# Component Dev Test

(Link to the live site)[https://slimjim49j.github.io/component_dev_test]

## Installation:
- Download / clone the repo with Git
- Make sure you have npm + node installed, and run ```npm i``` in the project root directory
- Run ```npm start``` to start the local server
- Navigate over to ```localhost:3000/component_dev_test```

Some Slight Modifications:
- used Open Sans instead Helvetica Neue
- used an arrow Ionicon next to the "let's talk" button, since no asset for that icon was provided
